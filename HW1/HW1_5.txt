Why is C++ called C++ and not ++C?

In C, `++ var` increments the value of `var` before processing the statement, whereas `var ++` increments the value after the statement.

C was introduced before C++, and C++ is a language built upon C rather than changing C itself. Therefore we use post increment rather than prefix increment.
